# scenario-based-spring-boot


### 1. **Project set up**
Scenario: You are tasked with creating a Spring Boot application for a library management system. The application should expose REST APIs to manage books and authors.

**Question**: How would you set up the project structure, and which Spring Boot dependencies would you include in your `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`?


### 2. **REST API Development**

Scenario: You need to create a REST API to fetch a list of books by a specific author.

**Question**: How would you design the controller, service, and repository layers for this functionality? Provide an example of the endpoint and its implementation.



### 3. **Database Integration**

Scenario: The library system needs to store book and author details in a relational database.

**Question**: How would you configure Spring Boot to connect to a MySQL database? What annotations would you use to map the `Book` and `Author` entities?

### 4. **Error Handling**

Scenario: A user tries to fetch details of a book that does not exist in the database.

**Question**: How would you handle this scenario gracefully and return an appropriate HTTP status code and error message?
