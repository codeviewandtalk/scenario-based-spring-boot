# scenario-based-spring-boot


### 1. **Project set up**
Scenario: You are tasked with creating a Spring Boot application for a library management system. The application should expose REST APIs to manage books and authors.

**Question**: How would you set up the project structure, and which Spring Boot dependencies would you include in your `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`?


### 2. **REST API Development**

Scenario: You need to create a REST API to fetch a list of books by a specific author.

**Question**: How would you design the controller, service, and repository layers for this functionality? Provide an example of the endpoint and its implementation.



### 3. **Database Integration**

Scenario: The library system needs to store book and author details in a relational database.

**Question**: How would you configure Spring Boot to connect to a MySQL database? What annotations would you use to map the `Book` and `Author` entities?

### 4. **Error Handling**

Scenario: A user tries to fetch details of a book that does not exist in the database.

**Question**: How would you handle this scenario gracefully and return an appropriate HTTP status code and error message?


### 5. **Basic Spring Security**

- Scenario: You need to secure the library management system so that only authenticated users can access the APIs.

  **Question**: How would you implement authentication and authorization in your Spring Boot application? What configurations would you add to secure the endpoints?


### 6. **Spring Boot Profiles**

- Scenario: The application needs to run in different environments (development, testing, production) with different database configurations.  

  **Question**: How would you use Spring Boot profiles to manage environment-specific configurations?



### 7. **Caching**

- Scenario: The API to fetch book details is frequently called, and you want to improve its performance by caching the results.  

  **Question**: How would you implement caching in your Spring Boot application? Which annotations and configurations would you use?


### 8. **Asynchronous Processing**

- Scenario: You need to send an email notification to users when a new book is added, but this process should not block the main thread.  

  **Question**: How would you implement asynchronous processing in Spring Boot for this use case?
### 9. **Spring Boot Actuator**

- Scenario: The operations team wants to monitor the health and metrics of the application.  

  **Question**: How would you enable and configure Spring Boot Actuator to expose health and metrics endpoints?


### 10. **File Upload/Download**

- Scenario: The application needs to allow users to upload and download book cover images.  

  **Question**: How would you implement file upload and download functionality in Spring Boot?

### 11. **Scheduler**

- Scenario: You need to implement a scheduled task that runs every day at midnight to archive old book records.  

  **Question**: How would you implement this functionality in Spring Boot?

### 12. **Custom Annotations**

- Scenario: You want to create a custom annotation to validate that the book's publication date is not in the future.  

  **Question**: How would you create and use a custom annotation for this validation?
